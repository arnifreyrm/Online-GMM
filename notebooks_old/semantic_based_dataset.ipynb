      "The paper aims at investigating whether Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) can have a role in facilitating regional Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3). Drawing on the economic geography approach to S3, we formulate some hypotheses about the impact that KETs-related knowledge can have on the construction of new regional technological advantages (RTAs). By crossing regional data on patent applications, in KETs-mapped classes of the International Patent Classification (IPC), with a number of regional economic indicators, we test these hypotheses on a panel of 26 European countries over the period 1980-2010. KETs show a positive impact on the construction of new RTAs, pointing to a new “enabling” role for them. KETs also exert a negative moderating role on the RTAs impact of the density of related pre-existing technologies, pointing to the KETs capacity of making the latter less binding in pursuing S3. Overall, the net-impact of KETs is positive, pointing to a new case for plugging KETs in the S3 policy tool-box.\n",

      "Technologies move beyond VPNs, encryption to prevent break-ins.\n",
      "Security vendors this week will introduce products that move beyond basic encryption and virtual private networking to incorporate technologies to help prevent intrusions and unauthorized connections.\n",
      "AirDefense Inc. is rolling out its new ActiveDefense appliance, which includes functionality that can block intrusion attempts and trap attackers onto a phony, dead-end WLAN connection. Known as AirBlock and AirTrap, the new features work in tandem once an intrusion attempt is detected.\n",
      "When an attacker connects to the network, the appliance identifies the offending session and terminates it. Then, as the attacker tries to re-connect, the appliance starts broadcasting a service set identifier and impersonating a wireless access point. The system forces the attacker to connect to the appliance instead of the access point and then traps the attacker there until he or she either leaves the area or the administrator terminates the persons session.\n",
      "\"Knowing that theres an unauthorized user on your network isnt that much help unless you can do something about it,\" said Jay Chaudhry, CEO of AirDefense, based in Alpharetta, Ga.\n",
      "The company is also working on a technology that would use Global Positioning System data to triangulate the location of attackers attempting to connect to a protected network.\n",
      "AirDefense this week also will release Version 2.0 of its intrusion detection software. The release includes protocol analysis and vendor fingerprinting functionality as well as correlation of network alerts. An updated policy manager enables administrators to set up policies requiring all machines and access points to have Wired Equivalent Privacy enabled or to filter new connections by media access control address.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Latis Networks Inc. is unveiling a WLAN version of its Border Guard intrusion prevention software. Much like ActiveDefense, Border Guard Wireless is designed to prevent attackers from getting a foothold on wireless networks.\n",
      "The software utilizes a user-defined list of machines that are allowed to connect to the network and rejects all other connection attempts. The system includes a granular access- control management feature that lets administrators set different levels of access for each user.\n",
      "For example, an administrator could set up a policy granting Internet-only access privileges to certain departments, while allowing senior management and executives access to the Internet and the internal network.\n",
      "Customers say such advanced protection schemes have been a long time coming to the wireless market.\n",
      "\"The need for this kind of stuff is very clear,\" said Jerry Lebow, co-chairman of Vytek Wireless Inc., a Latis customer and provider of wireless infrastructure products, based in White Plains, N.Y. \"Wireless data is going to be a very big business, and the problem of security in these networks in not insignificant.\"\n",

      "The probability of a computer-run world has long replaced the possibility of the concept, and the rapid rate with which we are approaching the days in which robots run the place is disturbing. It's so disturbing that Stephen Hawking even warned us to leave the planet before it happens! As funny as Hawking was, it's not likely that he was trolling mankind with his warning but being very serious.\n",
      "Our tech has developed at such an alarming rate that it's inevitable. A robot has already been given citizen status in one country and people are using robots for everything from driving to sex. Robots may already be acting against their humans' wishes based on their own programming; all it will take is a robot to be programmed to make the world a better place before The Terminator happens.\n",

      "The question of the value of artificial flowers (of the conventional sort) had come up, and after a good deal of conversation, I remarked, \"By the way, I’d like to clarify a simple point. There has never been an artificial plant that was even vaguely similar to a real one\". This produced a roomful of blank looks, puzzled expressions, and raised eyebrows — symptoms, I would submit, of the difficulty we have in understanding life today.\n",
      "I went on to explain: a plant is living. It expresses itself into the world as movement. It grows from seed to leaf to flower to fruit to seed. (I ought, at this point, to have mimicked the opening of a flower with my arms.) The plant gestures its existence; this gesturing, not some frozen form or substance, is what it is. No artificial plant duplicates this reality in any meaningful way.\n",
      "As I said, the point has been working on me. It brought to mind a talk I heard ten or fifteen years ago by one of our then-local doctors, Philip Incao. He asked those of us in the audience to close our eyes and take a minute to imagine the human circulatory system. And, yes, we all imagined things — the heart, arteries, veins, red blood cells, and so on. The fact that the circulatory system is a system of movement — that it is most essentially a doing — was hardly uppermost in our minds. Dr. Incao went on to cite a remark by Novalis: the body is a formed stream.\n",
      "My colleague, Craig Holdrege, once illustrated this by explaining how the spiraling fibers of the heart muscle that help to direct the blood in its flow are themselves a congealed image of the swirling vortex of blood within. This kind of mutuality holds even for the heart’s basic structural divisions:\n",
      "Before the heart has developed walls (septa) separating the four chambers from each other, the blood already flows in two distinct \"currents\" through the heart. The [currents] flowing through the right and left sides of the heart do not mix, but stream and loop by each other, just as two currents in a body of water. In the \"still water zone\" between the two currents, the septum dividing the two chambers forms. Thus the movement of the blood gives the parameters for the inner differentiation of the heart, just as the looping heart redirects the flow of blood. (The Dynamic Heart and Circulation, edited by Craig Holdrege. Fair Oaks CA: AWSNA, 2002, p. 12)\n",
      "Our inherited mode of thought today tells us that things produce movement. The more fundamental reality is just the opposite: particular things crystallize out of the right sort of movement. The tendency to materialize and, indeed, mechanize life in our imaginations, when unchecked, pretty much determines our philosophical conclusions about life before we ever get a conversation going on the subject. This is how we manufacture the notion of synthetic life.\n",
      "It happens that in my own talk at the Hastings Center I had quoted the twentieth-century cell biologist, Paul Weiss, to the effect that \"Life is a dynamic process. Logically, the elements of a process can be only elementary processes, and not elementary particles or any other static units\". In a 1963 paper, Weiss wrote:\n",
      "Stable structures that are demonstrable in the living cell, other than chromosomes, have mostly turned out to be secondary derivatives, rather than primary carriers, of cellular organization . . . [There is] such incessant reshuffling of the cell content that even the thought that at last the supramolecular units (particulates) might be linked into a stable framework can be safely dismissed . . . cell contour, intracellular fiber systems, and granules of various descriptions change their configurations and positions continuously, thus ruling out the presence, or at any rate, the relevance, of a consistent three-dimensional cytoskeleton . . . Yet despite the absence of an orderly static frame, the various activities of all parts remain coordinated in the maintenance of a standard pattern of order in any given cell. It is an order of relations rather than of fixed positions. (\"The Cell as Unit\", Journal of Theoretical Biology vol. 5, 1963, pp. 389-97)\n",
      "There are countless molecular processes going on in the cell and organism as a whole, continuing through time, and Weiss points out that these are interlocking processes, like \"civic activities in a community\". Every stage of every process must be in a certain proper correspondence with every stage of every other process. The plant’s movement, in other words, is compounded of countless submovements, and these are harmonized in the distinctive gesturing of the plant as a whole.\n",
      "I find it interesting to compare this line of thought with the notions of someone like AI guru, Ray Kurzweil. After all, artificial intelligence researchers and synthetic biology researchers share much of the same general naïveté about life. In The Age of Spiritual Machines Kurzweil talks about \"reverse engineering\" the brain by analyzing it, thin slice by thin slice, and then \"implementing\" its neurons and their supposed inputs and outputs in a computer.\n",
      "Suppose we could do far better than that. Suppose we didn’t have to be content with merely abstracting a few features from brains — features that a computer engineer such as Kurzweil (or anyone else) happens to think, with rather blatant arbitrariness, are the few that really count. (Actually, there is not a single feature of the embodied brain that is faithfully captured in any computer model. But that is a point for another time.) Assume instead that we could assemble precise replicas of those brain slices, atom by atom, successively adding each slice to the previous ones. Would we then have produced a living brain by artificial means?\n",
      "The question is rather like asking whether an artificial flower is a living flower. It is to have forgotten almost everything about the reality of the brain. What has happened to the movement? For example, as we were assembling those slices, how were the individual cells being nourished? How were the intercellular fluids and blood circulating among them? How were any living processes actually occurring in the cells — the essential chemical signaling that takes place within and between cells, enabling them to retain a living connection to each other; the intricately coordinated replication of DNA; the entire elaborate process of regulation of gene expression; cell division, bringing into movement as it does everything in the cell . . . ?\n",
      "It’s one thing to assemble many pieces of a complex puzzle, and quite another to establish a harmonious coordination among a complex set of interweaving processes — a coordination that would require the setting in motion, at a particular instant, of every one of the countless elements of the cell in exactly the right relation to all the other dynamic processes. And the coordination would have to be so calculated that the thousands of ongoing, continually interpenetrating processes would be held together as a single, coherent whole — held together through all the unforeseeable disturbances and environmental encounters differentially affecting all those interrelated processes as the synthetic organism traverses its path through life. I see little evidence that the \"synbio\" proponents have much appreciation of the real nature of their task.\n",
      "The tendency, I think, is to assume that you need only put the right set of puzzle pieces together, and somehow the processes will automatically start up and proceed as they ought. They will \"emerge\", as the jargon goes, indicating a kind of mystical potential in the puzzle pieces. This is why a number of commentators have recognized in the supposedly all-explaining DNA of modern biology something like an animistic totem or materialized entelechy.\n",
      "Remove this kind of materialized magic, and what would you actually have after assembling the last molecules of your artificial brain? The answer is easy: an object perfectly fitted for display in Madame Tussaud’s wax museum.\n",
      "You may think that such a thought experiment is ridiculously simplistic. I agree. But thought experiments just like this one have been common for decades in fields such as cognitive science. You can be sure that proponents of today’s \"synthetic biology\" will have a penchant for similar mental excursions.\n",
      "At the Hastings conference there were in fact various references to the possibility of assembling a living, single-celled organism from scratch, molecule by molecule — an organism that was \"precisely identical\" to some already living organism. You’ll note what’s going on here. The \"precisely identical\" idea comes from the image of an organism already murdered in the imagination, just like the artificial plant that is \"indistinguishable\" from a real one. The life was removed from the image in advance, and so, of course, the artificial product becomes very persuasive as a replica of the real one.\n",
      "It was evident that a number of the participants (the group was quite diverse) simply took for granted the realistic prospects for such an artificial construction. On my part, I do not even know what could be meant by constructing an artificial cell \"precisely identical\" to a real one. The real cell, after all, is never at two different moments identical to itself, let alone to another cell. It’s as much a gesture as a thing.\n",
      "It’s not only that life is movement. Equally important is the fact that each kind of life displays a qualitatively distinct sort of movement. When we bother to observe a real organism, we find that its gesturing is recognizably different from that of other species. An oak tree does not at all have the same way of being as a weeping willow, nor is an amoeba’s movement (whether at the level of the whole organism or of molecular process) choreographed in the style of a paramecium’s.\n",
      "If and when I hear synthetic biologists discussing among themselves how they will reproduce such a unique gesturing — a gesturing they must carefully and deliberately and knowledgeably compound out of the innumerable molecular activities proceeding simultaneously and interdependently in the cell — all in order to produce from scratch a particular sort of organism with a particular sort of recognizable character, then I will believe they have begun to glimpse a problem that might just conceivably define a synthetic discipline of life. Otherwise, we’re left with little more than the crude and mostly ignorant, trial-and-error manipulation of already living things.\n",
      "The work in synthetic biology as we have it today does in fact rely thoroughly upon already living things. A synthetic construct is inserted into a living organism, and the organism then takes it up (if the experiment is successful) and incorporates it into its own being in its own manner. If you want to know how this actually plays out in reality — how the organism \"does its own thing\" with such foreign materials, often in radically unexpected ways — then check out the website, nontarget.org. No one who fairly reviews that website can come away thinking we have a science of synthetic biology, as opposed to a technologically sophisticated discipline of tinkering.\n",
      "In sum, the imagination at work in synthetic biology is grounded (often without acknowledgment of the fact) in the world of living organisms — organisms that are continually taken for granted, rarely observed as the living, gesturing creatures they are, and then casually employed as a means to assimilate and enliven artificial constructs. The result is viewed as a triumph of clever artifice, which it doubtless is. But this is no reason to lose sight of the creative contribution of the organism itself. Through its living activity it proves wonderfully capable of meeting the contents of its environment — internal or external, natural or artificially constructed — and drawing them up into its own life.\n",

      "One day your hard drive could just be a pile of plastic. Researchers have coded a word into short chains of plastic molecules, which could be used as a space-saving way to store our mountains of data – or even to reveal counterfeit goods.\n",
      "DNA has shown some promise in holding millions of bits of information in a tiny volume. But DNA is fragile and hard to write and read. So Jean-François Lutz at the Institut Charles Sadron in Strasbourg, France, has been experimenting with more customisable chains of plastic molecules that can encode information in similar ways.\n",
      "Also known as polymers, these chains are made up of two kinds of molecules that stand for the 1s and 0s of digital computer code. Previous research has seen data stored in single long chains, but these become harder to read as the length increases, so the storage record stands at just 10 bits.\n",
      "Lutz’s team had a different approach. “Instead of making very long chains, the idea is to create a library of very short chains,” he says. As a demonstration, the team wrote the acronym CNRS, the abbreviation for the French National Center for Scientific Research, across six polymers – a 32-bit message when encoded using standard ASCII characters.\n",
      "The researchers read the message by sorting the chains from shortest to longest using a mass spectrometer and then sequencing the chains by breaking them apart molecule-by-molecule. The shorter chains, less than a nanometre each, are easier to manage than one long one, while their varying length keeps the data in the right order.\n",
      "“I think it’s an encouraging step,” says Luis Ceze at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n",
      "To store big chunks of information, researchers will have to scale up the technology to make large libraries of chains, Ceze says. In addition, it would be quicker to write data into the molecules if the chains could be synthesised in parallel rather than one at a time, he adds\n",
      "While writing and reading these polymers is currently expensive, there are some high-end uses for them. Embedding coded polymers in pricey electronics or artworks could label them with the maker’s or owner’s identity, says Lutz. Reading a sample of the molecule chains would let investigators discover the source of the object, helping them find counterfeits and stolen goods.\n",
      "Both DNA and synthetic polymers have the potential to shrink the size needed for data storage, says Reza Zadegan at Boise State University in Idaho. That’s important, since the world’s data is piling up faster than our ability to store it. In 2040, the amount of space needed to keep our data in silicon chips could be as large as a small country, perhaps twice the size of Liechtenstein, he says.\n",
      "Using several types of molecules would let researchers write in a code that packs more information into shorter sequences than binary 0s and 1s can, says Zadegan. While scientists have introduced two artificial letters into DNA for a total of six letters, it could be simpler to design an entirely new plastic molecule alphabet. “These polymers are perhaps easier to deal with if you want to expand the language,” he says.\n",

Instead of going through that routine, try installing the Geode Firefox extension, the Greasemonkey extension, and the Google Maps and Geode Greasemonkey script. Armed with them, the next time you visit Google Maps you'll see a new Current Position link next to the search box that will instantly locate you on a map.

      "When was the last time you heard someone in Los Angeles talk about how much he loves to parallel park? Is it fair to say, never? If you detest parallel parking, you’re not alone. In fact, the task is so daunting that some car makers have installed “park-assist” technology in a few high-end models to make the dreaded maneuver easier for drivers.\n",
      "Can You Trust Self-Parking Cars?\n",
      "If you’re hesitant to jump on the self-parking bandwagon, consider this: in a recent study conducted by AAA, humans battled against cars that were enabled with self-parking features and the results were quite humbling, at least to the human drivers who participated, anyway. Findings included the following:\n",
      "- Self-parking cars hit the curb 81 percent less than human participants did.\n",
      "- Park-assist cars used 47 percent fewer maneuvers than humans to get in their spots.\n",
      "- The cars were able to get 37 percent closer to the curb than human drivers.\n",
      "- The self-parking cars were able to perform the parallel parking task 10 percent faster than humans.\n",
      "Nearly 80 percent of the drivers who participated claimed to be confident in their parallel parking abilities, but were still clearly beaten out by the self-parking cars. And despite the evidence that these cars do a better job at the tricky maneuver, only one in four drivers surveyed by AAA said they trust the vehicles to park for them.\n",
      "Research shows that 90 percent of crashes are caused by human error. Moreover, all of the collisions that have involved self-driving cars so far occurred because of mistakes made by humans.\n",
      "Nothing Is Perfect\n",
      "Like humans, self-parking cars aren’t perfect. Everyone makes mistakes, but if you suffer from injuries because of another driver’s error, you may be entitled to receive compensation.

      "A film based on the classic Mattel toy car line has been in development since 2003, and has seen the likes of McG (Terminator Salvation) and Simon Crane (second unit director on Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) jockeying to direct for companies as varied as Columbia, Warner Bros. and most recently Legendary Pictures. The latter is still onboard the project, which is currently out to writers. We’d heard rumors that there was a writer’s room staffed for the project, but all that may be out the window now that Lin is onboard. Alex Garcia is overseeing the project for Legendary.\n",
      "Lin most recently helmed this summer’s Star Trek Beyond, which was a hit with fans and critics but disappointed at the worldwide box office, becoming the lowest-grossing of Paramount’s franchise reboot trilogy.\n",

      "Most finance companies will require boats to be insured throughout the length of the loan. However, many folks discontinue their insurance once that is paid off and some who buy their boat outright never think to insure it.\n",
      "Many people operate under the misconception that between their auto and home insurance, their boat, motor, trailer and contents are covered.\n",
      "The average homeowner insurance policy will offer limited liability coverage for a boat that is 14’ or less with 25hp or smaller motor. However that will not cover in the instance of an oil or fuel spill, and there is no coverage for theft of the boat, motor or trailer. Be sure and check with your agent to see what is / is not covered under your homeowner policy when it comes to your boat.\n",
      "Now, your auto policy is a bit different. If the boat is being towed, the liability portion of your auto coverage will extend to pay for damages done by you. (Ex: you back into a vehicle with your trailer) However, damages to your boat/motor/trailer are not covered by the Comprehensive/Collision coverage on your auto policy.\n",
      "If you own and operate a boat, it is wise to properly insure your boat, motor, trailer and contents.\n",
      "A good boat policy will offer liability which protects the other people in the case of injuries due to a boating accident in which you are at fault and physical damage coverage to protect the boat itself. You can also get coverage for the lower unit of your outboard motor and/or both upper & lower unit coverage for your sterndrive motor, on-water towing, fishing equipment coverage and wreckage removal. Some policies offer agreed value and/or total loss replacement coverage as well. There are other additional insurance options such as Med Pay, Uninsured Boater Bodily Injury and personal property coverage.\n",
      "As with any insurance policy, it is always wise to document (with photos or videos) the contents and equipment on your boat (trolling motor, life preserves, fishing equipment, depth finders, etc.)\n",
      "Some boat policies will cover theft of items such as those listed above, but in most instances, there must be evidence of forced entry (EX: the closed and locked compartments pried open).\n",
      "Another good reason to insure your boat is the discount(s) that may be available to you for multi or companion (or bundling) policies (EX: boat & auto; home and boat, etc.)\n",
      "Above are several reasons to properly insure your boat, motor, trailer and contents. Don’t wait until there’s an incident, call us today and let us get’cha covered!\n",

      "Americans spend an average of 15 hours a week in a car, at least according to this Arbitron study. That’s like two hours a day! Here at Carfree with Kids, we don’t spend any average time in a car — time in a car for us is always weird and usually involves crying children. But cars are private space. Yes, you can see into most cars, but being in a car you are insulated from the outside world. In contrast, we do all of our transportation in public — walking, biking, or taking transit.\n",
      "This actually impacts our parenting. Whether it’s on a train, bus, or bike, our children are being transported in public. That means that the tired baby who screams on the way home from the Children’s Museum is screaming in public. The preschooler who has trouble sitting still is squirming and singing too loudly in public. The toddler who doesn’t want to stop playing at the park is thrashing about in a stroller or on a bike in public (on a disastrous ride home from spy pond a couple weeks ago I really wanted a sign that said “they cry in car seats all the time people”). Parents who transport their children in cars have to deal with just as much challenging behavior, but they often do it in the privacy of their own car, where they can be insulated from the harsh judgment of people who would certainly never let their kids behave like that. That won’t stop the screaming, but in a car you can at least tell yourself that your kids aren’t driving other people crazy, just you.\n",
      "Those anti-kid people who think children and their parents should all be shipped to the moon absolutely hate us, I’m sure. But while there are lots of obvious drawbacks to parenting through transitions in public, there are some benefits as well. First, you get to interact with so many different kinds of people. I’d like right now to say a huge “Thank you!” to all the bus and train riders who have ever stopped to wave at, play peek-a-boo with, or chat with my kids. We get a chance to see new people at every stop, and sometimes that leads to interesting conversations, like the time our daughter, around 2.5 at the time, saw a pink-haired young woman heading to an anime convention in Boston and told Nathan, in a loud stage whisper, “Some grownups have different hair!” which generated a lot of smiles and led to a very sweet interaction between the two of them. You get to answer questions about people hauling furniture, dogs, and suitcases, people who have noticeable physical differences, people who speak different languages, and people who are behaving badly. Generally, you get to help your children to respond appropriately to the unexpected.\n",
      "You also get a chance to practice manners and good behavior in a variety of different situations. Can your child be quiet during a morning commute? Handle sitting next to people she doesn’t know? Stand up on the train while still remaining calm? All of these situations come with social pressure to behave well, which can be both good and bad. But they certainly do allow the whole family to practice appropriate behavior in a public setting. We’re currently working with our four-year-old on sitting with some level of propriety in a skirt, and I don’t think we would be doing it if we weren’t riding trains regularly. We tend to get compliments on our kids’ sociability and manners, and some of this comes from the skills they learn in our many public interactions.\n",
      "The other place where we feel very visible is when we ride our bike. Our beautiful Xtracycle gets a lot of attention, and both Nathan and I have noticed that when we ride it, even if the kids aren’t with us, we feel pressure to be good biking citizens, and in particular to obey traffic laws. This has more to do with having an easily identifiable bike than with being carfree, but it still seems to fit here. If I run a red light, I know that the people behind me can easily look me up (our blog url is on the license plate), and that helps me resist the temptation.\n",

      "With an Anthony Caro show currently on view at Mitchell-Innes & Nash gallery in New York, we turn back through the ARTnews archives. Because the show brings together very early and very late work from the British artist’s career, we have selected one old excerpt, by Lawrence Alloway, and one new sample, by William Feaver, who in 2014 wrote an essay following Caro’s death the year before. Both excerpts follow below.\n",
      "“Art news from London”\n",
      "By Lawrence Alloway\n",
      "The “geometry of fear” phase of British postwar sculpture is over. The linearism of the 1940s and early ’50s is rarely seen now. Iron has declined in popularity and traditional materials are back in use. This has returned mass to sculpture. Kenneth Armitage spoke for a number of the younger sculptors when he commented on a visit to Calder Hall, Britain’s atomic power station: “A living Léger perhaps, but the excessively immaculate and organized space made me long for some dirt and untidiness.” “There was comfort,” he added, “in thinking that even here there must be a lavatory: or that somewhere, surely, a misguided spider might be laying her eggs.”\n",
      "A generalization about current British sculpture must include: solidity, traditional materials, room for spider’s eggs and a dislike of highly abstracted forms. There are exceptions, of course: Robert Adams, for example, reveals a renewed interest in Gonzalez and the now-popular Lynn Chadwick is, on the whole, outside this tendency towards non-geometric images. His metal forms, punning on the resemblance of mechanical and organic life, seem humanoids of the 1940s rather than new faces. Two sculptors who typify the present tendency (both were born in 1924 and both show at Gimpel) are Anthony Caro and Hubert Dalwood.\n",
      "With dollops of matter and unbendable projections, Caro builds up burly nudes and massive busts. The new thickness has deceived some critics. As the sculpture is not linear and as the human image is overwhelmingly insisted on, they have tried to read the figures in terms of Renaissance mechanics. Thus a pregnant woman of Caro’s was said to carry herself without a due regard to the baby’s weight. What Caro dramatizes is the emergence of human beings out of raw material. The presence of the plaster and the bronze is always part of the sculpture; its gritty mass, partly defeated by the sculptor, partly victorious over him, is always there. The untidy process of creation leaves its traces on the sculptures and this as much as the drama of the work is the action of the represented figure. The detail on these craggy figures is often indeterminate: this has the effect of siting the appearance of the sculpture somewhere between rocks and newspaper photographs.\n",
      "“Why Anthony Caro Broke the Rules”\n",
      "By William Feaver\n",
      "“A sort of digested cubist thinking is at the root of most of the interesting sculpture that’s going on,” Caro wrote to me in 1973; he was reflecting then on the legacy of Picasso and, obviously, speaking primarily for himself. As a born-again Cubist in the ways he treated his materials—clamping them, abutting them, clustering them—he upheld the philosophy of synthesis: that untiring appetite for the reconciliation of disparate parts into congruent wholes.\n",
      "His Cubism was businesslike. From Early One Morning onward, his career was geared toward the occupation of spaces, from closest indoors to greatest outdoors. He worked on such a scale that, relishing opportunities, he could locate processional quantities of his Greco-Romanesque Cubism on Park Avenue and in the Tuileries—not so much for his own satisfaction as in the belief that such grand temporary implants could do wonders for the cause of modern sculpture. Millbank Steps, a 75-foot-long array of bulwark ziggurats in Corten steel, made in 2004 for his Tate Britain retrospective the following year, was one of the last great monuments he created in this spirit of inspired bravado.\n",
      "Caro punctuated his life’s work with telling shows: at the Museum of Modern Art in 1975; in Trajan Markets in Rome in 1992, where each piece sat in its own ancient, roofless cubicle; and, most recently, at the Museo Correr in Venice, a display that, characteristically, he willed into being, against all logistical odds. The exhibitions proclaimed him the great Caro. From Hopscotch (1962) and Garland (1970) to River Song (2012), with its steel haunches housing a great red Perspex slab, this was a roll call of all that he did best.\n",
